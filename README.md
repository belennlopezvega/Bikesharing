# NYC CitiBike Sharing

## Overview
In this statistical analysis we will be going over data from the CitiBike Sharing program based in New York City.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to visually share the results with investors in order to secure the capital needed to start a bikesharing business in Des Moines, and demonstrate how it could work.


## Results
Below are the findings that the data shows in visual form. 

#### Customers

According to the above image, out of the 2.3 million total customers, more than 75% of them are subscribers. The others are one-time users. This would mean the majority of the consumers would consistently be bringing in cash flow as they subscribe to the service.

#### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

Moving on to the gender of users and weekday usage, out of the subscribers there are more male than female users. There are also more male one-time customers but the difference isn't as significant as it is with the subscribers group. For both genders there is also more bike usage during the week versus weekends, where as with the one-time customers group Saturday tends to see the most usage. 

#### Trips by Weekday and by Gender for Each Hour

Looking at first image, Trips by Weekday for Each Hour, Monday - Friday sees a peak at 8:00 am and between 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm. This can correlate to morning and evening commutes to and from work. During weekends there is consistent usage between 11:00 am - 5:00 pm. 

Looking at the second image, Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour), we see a similar trend on weekdays and weekends, with the exception of mostly male usage throughout the entire week.

#### Checkout Times for Users and by Gender

Looking at both images,  we can confirm that there are more males using the CitiBikes. Furthermore, we can see that the bikes are primarily used for short periods of time, with the peak being at 5 minutes. This can correlate with quick commutes to and from work, or quick city errands. The same 5 minute peak is also seen in female users. 

#### Top Starting Locations

In New York City, we see that the top starting location is based around Manhattan which can be a touristy area. In addition, there are a lot of businesses in that area which can have an effect on why bike usage seems to be common there. 

#### Average Trip Duration

In this last visual, we can see those born in the Millennial generation have consistently higher trip duration than other generations. However, there is an outlier with those born in 1970 that show the overall highest trip duration by a significant amount. 


## Summary

Overall, this bikesharing program works well in New York City as the data shows that there would be customer retention as majority of overall users are subscribers which would result in consistent cash flow. Many of the subscribers seem to use the bikes as a means to get to and from work meaning they rely on weekly bike usage. As Des Moines is the capital and most populous city in Iowa, bringing this program could have a lot of potential and this could be a huge opportunity. To further support this, we suggest visualizations of the amount of people who rely on public transportation in Des Moines. In addition, we also recommend visuals of how CitiBikes performs in NYC in the winter months to have a better understanding of how usage would be in those colder months.
